Getting started
===============

New to Pyom? Or to metadirectories? Well, you came to the right
place: read this material to quickly get up and running.

Copied from Wikipedia which is, as everyone knows, the authority:

A metadirectory system provides for the flow of data between one or more directory 
services and databases, in order to maintain synchronization of that data, and is 
an important part of identity management systems. 
The data being synchronized typically are collections of entries that contain user 
profiles and potentially authentication or policy information. Most metadirectory 
deployments synchronize data into at least one LDAP-based directory server, to 
ensure that LDAP-based applications such as single sign-on and portal servers 
have access to recent data, even if the data is mastered in a non-LDAP data source.

Metadirectory products support filtering and transformation of data in transit.

The Openmetadir_ project was started by SWAMI_ 
because the members felt there was a need for a open source metadir implementation.

Pyom is the Python_ implementation of the OpenMetadir specification.

    If you're new to Python_, you might want to start by getting an idea of what
    the language is like. Pyom is 100% Python, so if you've got minimal
    comfort with Python you'll probably get a lot more out of Pyom.
    
    If you're new to programming entirely, you might want to start with this
    `list of Python resources for non-programmers`_
    
    If you already know a few other languages and want to get up to speed with
    Python quickly, we recommend `Dive Into Python`_ (also available in a
    `dead-tree version`_). If that's not quite your style, there are quite
    a few other `books about Python`_.
