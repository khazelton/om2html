Quick install guide
===================

Before you can use Pyom, you'll need to get it installed. This guide 
will guide you to a simple, minimal installation
that'll work while you walk through the introduction.

Install Pyom
------------

For all this to work you need to have Python installed. Right now it has to be 
a 2.X version, where X > 4 .

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have to download and install the following packages.

- rdfmarshal 
    Produced by the same project that brings you **pyom**.
    I'd really like to urge you to make yourself familiar with rdfmarshal 
    before attempting to use pyom. Since pyom is heavily dependent on rdfmarshal.
    
    Load the latest source by subversion::
    
      svn co https://repository.umdac.umu.se/svn/om2/trunk/rdfmarshal
      
    Not yet available at the cheese shop.

- pyOpenSSL
    http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net/
    
    Developed using version 0.6, guess it will work with 0.7,
    can be automatically downloaded by using `easy_install 
    <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_.
    
- Twisted
    You also need twisted at least version 2.5.0.
    http://twistedmatrix.com/ is the official website for twisted.
    You must download the code from there.
    Twisted appears on the cheese shop, but at least on the OS X installation
    I tried it, it would not install properly.
    **Note** if you want to use dynamic resolving of address you either have to patch the 2.5.0 version
    (patches included) or install 3.0.0 or later .
    
- elementTree
    You can either download it from here http://effbot.org/downloads/#elementtree and build
    it yourself or you can downloaded using easy_install
    
- httplib2
    http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/


Quick build instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Once you have installed all the necessary prerequisites a simple::
  
    python setup.py install
    
  will install the basic code.

  After that you have to install the ontologies, run::
  
    tools/base_ontologies.py
    
  and rerun::
  
    python setup.py install

  After this you ought to be able to run the tests without an hitch.
  The tests are based on the pypy test environment, so::
  
    py.test test
    
  is what you should use.
