I assume that you have the rest of the documentation or at least have a working setup of
a Neo repository and knows how to configure and start a node. If that is not the case you have
some work before you :-).

The GUI is a javascript which can be provided to the web client by a simple web server. 
Due to restrictions on javascripts the ajax server part have to reside on the same web server.
It is not sufficient to be on the same machine with another port number, it has to be the 
same machine and the same port number.

The fetch the javascript by doing::

wget http://www.windh.com/om2/groupadmin.war

Unpacking is a simple unziping in a place of your choice.
After unpacking you will have to look for a file named groupadmin/Grouped.html .
In this file you must configure where the ajax server is. It's this line you have to change::

  var generalSettings = { serverUrl:"http://xenosmilus.umdc.umu.se/cgi-bin/om2jsonrpc" }; 

to be consistent with your setup.

The code for the ajax server can be found :ref:`here <grouped-om2jsonrpc>` .

In this you have to change at the end of the file where you have your Neo repository and
where the receiver node is.

And that's it !!

**Note!** Right now the access control is not fully implemented, so everyone can do everything.
This will change in the future.
