.. module:: api

============
Motivation ?
============

The rise and fall of a metadirectory is how easy it is to get information into and out of the system.
I expect organizations to build graphical used interfaces to alleviate management of information that 
are not easily collected/exported from some system. To facilitate the building of these user interfaces
I am making available a JSON-RPC and a REST interface to a OM2 cloud.
This is the documentation of these APIs.
