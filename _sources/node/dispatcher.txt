.. _node-dispatcher:

======================
The centre of the node
======================

The dispatcher is the central point of the node, it's where everything is connected.
It:

  * Receives a message from a listener,
  * uses the routers and
  * the resolvers that it has connected to it to get protocol/endpoint specifications and
  * finally will pick senders to use for sending the message.
  
It will also, if so configured, make sure that a message isn't lost during processing by
saving it on disc while working with it.

One might imaging having several different types of dispatchers with special functionality's.
And in fact that was how it started. But with the advent of the handlers the need for special
dispatcher has lessened.
